## \package pts.admin.do.create_resource_archives Create publishable archives for SKIRT 9 resources
#
# This script creates archives (ZIP files) containing SKIRT 9 resources that can be copied to the public server.
#
# SKIRT 9 resources are bundled into one or more archives. The core archive is required, the others are optional.
# In other words, SKIRT 9 users must download at least the core resource archive for the code to be functional.
# Each archive is versioned, and the download procedure at the user's side attempts to synchronize the downloaded
# version with the version required by the currently checked out version of the SKIRT 9 C++ code. It is important
# to maintain older versions of the archives on the public server (at least for a while) so that users can continue
# to employ them (for example, because a newer version of SKIRT has a compatibility issue or a show-stopping bug).
#
# This script expects the following directory structure:
#
#     <project-parent-directory>
#         PTS9
#         SKIRT9
#         Resources9
#             StoredTables
#                 TableDirA
#                 TableDirB
#                 TableDirC
#                 ...
#             Publish
#                 Archives
#                 Definitions
#                     Core
#                         include.txt
#                         version.txt
#                         history.txt
#                     ExtraA
#                         include.txt
#                         version.txt
#                         history.txt
#                     ExtraB
#                     ...
#
# An archive can be created for each subdirectory of the Definitions directory. Each of these subdirectories should
# contain three basic text files:
#
#   - include.txt: a list of StoredTables subdirectories to be included in the archive (one directory name per line)
#   - version.txt: the current version of this archive (a single integer number on the first line)
#   - history.txt: a human readable summary of the version history for this archive
#
# The archive will contain the (recursive) contents of the StoredTables subdirectories listed in the include.txt file,
# in addition to the version.txt and history.txt files, placed at the top level. The archive will be named
# "SKIRT9_Resources_name_vxx.zip", where name is replaced by the name of the corresponding Definitions subdirectory,
# and xx is replaced by the version number. The archive will be placed in the Resources9/Publish/Archives directory,
# replacing any existing file with the same name (but leaving files with earlier version numbers untouched).
#
# By default, the script creates an archive for each Definitions subdirectory. Specifying the \c --name=dirname option
# restricts creation to the specified subdirectory.
