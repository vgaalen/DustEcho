class Skirt:

    ## The constructor accepts an optional argument specifying the file path to the SKIRT executable to be used.
    # If the path is specified, it should include the "skirt" filename of the executable. Otherwise the path
    # is interpreted as described for the pts.utils.absPath() function.
    # If the path is not specified, the constructor looks for a SKIRT executable in the project structure including
    # this PTS source file, assuming that SKIRT is built under a \c ~/SKIRT9 or \c SKIRT directory residing next
    # to the PTS9 or PTS directory.

    ## This function invokes the SKIRT executable with the simulation and command line options corresponding to the
    #  values of the function arguments, as described below. The function returns a pts.simulation.simulation.Simulation
    #  instance corresponding to the simulation being performed (or attempted, in case of failure). The function
    #  supports asynchronous execution, allowing the caller to perform other tasks while the simulation is running.
    #
    # - \em skiFilePath: the file path for the configuration file (\em ski file) to be executed, interpreted as
    #   as described for the pts.utils.absPath() function.
    # - \em inDirPath: a string specifying the absolute or relative directory path for simulation input files.
    # - \em outDirPath: a string specifying the absolute or relative directory path for simulation output files.
    # - \em skiRelative: if \c True, the simulation input/output directory paths are relative to the directory of the
    #   \em ski file being executed; if \c False or missing, they are relative to the current directory.
    #
    # - \em numThreadsPerProcess: a positive integer specifying the number of parallel threads per process for the
    #   simulation. If zero or missing the number of logical cores on the host computer is used.
    # - \em numProcesses: a positive integer specifying the number of parallel MPI processes to be launched,
    #   or a string indicating that the number of processes and other aspects of the MPI configuration should be
    #   obtained at run time from the corresponding multi-node batch queueing system. Supported string values include
    #   'lsf' for the LSF queueing system and 'srun' for the SLURM queueing system. If the option is missing or
    #   has a value of zero or one, MPI is not used and just a single SKIRT process is launched.
    # - \em verbose: this option has effect only if the number of processes is larger than one. If set to \c True, each
    #   process creates its own complete log file. If missing or set to \em False, only the root process creates a
    #   full log file, and the other processes only create a log file when there are errors or warnings.
    #
    # - \em wait: if \c True or missing, the function waits until SKIRT execution completes; if \c False the function
    #   returns immediately after launching SKIRT without waiting for it.
    # - \em console: a string controlling console logging in synchronous execution mode: 'regular' means all SKIRT
    #   messages are logged to the console; 'brief' means only summary messages are logged to the console, and
    #   'silent' means no SKIRT messages are logged to the console. If \em wait is \c True or missing, the default
    #   logging mode is 'regular'. If \em wait is \c False, the logging mode is always 'silent'.
