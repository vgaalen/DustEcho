## \package pts.simulation.fits Handling SKIRT FITS output files
#
# This module offers functions for reading frames and data cubes from SKIRT FITS output files with support for units.

import numpy as np
import pts.utils as ut
from .units import unit as smunit

# -----------------------------------------------------------------

## This function loads the complete contents from a FITS file produced by SKIRT, and returns the resulting data frame
# or data cube as a two- or three-dimensional astropy quantity array. The indices of the array are in the order
# [x, y] for a data frame and [x, y, z] for a data cube, where x and y are usually spatial axes and z is often the
# wavelength axis. The appropriate units for the array values are obtained from the FITS file header written by SKIRT.
#
# The file path is interpreted as described for the pts.utils.absPath() function.
#
def loadFits(path):
    path = ut.absPath(path)
    data, header = fits.getdata(path, header=True)
    return data.T.astype(float) << smunit(header['BUNIT'])

# -----------------------------------------------------------------

## This function retrieves the axis grid points from a FITS file produced by SKIRT, and returns the result as a
# tuple of astropy quantity arrays: (x, y) for data frames or (x, y, z) for data cubes.
# The function assumes that x and y represent spatial axes with a regular, linear grid. For a data cube, the
# function expects the z-axis grid points (often wavelengths) to be listed in a binary table extension.
#
# The file path is interpreted as described for the pts.utils.absPath() function.
#
def getFitsAxes(path):
    # open the file
    path = ut.absPath(path)
    with fits.open(path) as hdul:
        # build x and y grids
        h = hdul[0].header
        x = _grid(h['NAXIS1'], h['CRPIX1'], h['CRVAL1'], h['CDELT1'], h['CUNIT1'])
        y = _grid(h['NAXIS2'], h['CRPIX2'], h['CRVAL2'], h['CDELT2'], h['CUNIT2'])
        # if there are only two axes, we're done
        if int(h['NAXIS']) == 2:
            return x,y

        # if there are three axis, read the z grid from the table extension
        hdu = hdul["Z-axis coordinate values"]
        z = hdu.data["GRID_POINTS"].astype(float) << smunit(hdu.header["TUNIT1"])
        return x,y,z

## This helper function constructs a regular linear grid based on the information for an axis in the FITS header
