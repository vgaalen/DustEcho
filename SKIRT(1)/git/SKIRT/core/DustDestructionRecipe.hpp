/** DustDestructionRecipe is an abstract class representing recipes for dynamically calculating
    radiative destruction of dust grains by iterating over the radiation field. The class derives
    from DynamicStateRecipe so that it fits in the overall dynamic medium state framework. It
    cooperates with the FragmentDustMixDecorator class to handle each dust mix fragment separately
    (i.e. different grain materials and/or grain size bins). A subclass can specify a concrete
    destruction recipe by implementing a single function that takes properties of the radiation
    field and grain population/size bin under study and returns the corresponding non-destroyed
    density fraction.

    When a DustDestructionRecipe instance is included in the dynamic state configuration of a
    simulation, it requires there to be one or more medium components with a
    FragmentDustMixDecorator material mix that has the \em hasDynamicDensities flag enabled. These
    media components will be automatically detected and handled. */
