/** The NameManager class assists an engine constructing or outputting a SMILE dataset with
    implementing conditional options and values. The overall goal is to dynamically adjust
    displayed options and default values to choices made earlier in the configuration process.
    These earlier choices may represent various aspects of the configuration, including the level
    of expertise selected by the user, some overall mode configured early on, or the value of the
    option just preceding this one. All the metadata needed to control these capabilities are
    defined as part of the SMILE schema.

    Through a NameManager object, an engine processing a SMILE dataset maintains two sets of names
    with a different scope. The global set contains names that stay around for the duration of the
    configuration session. The local set contains names that stay around only while considering the
    properties of a particular type; a fresh local set is created for each type instance. By
    definition, the global set contains names that start with an uppercase letter, and the local
    set contains names that start with a lowercase letter. As a result, the two sets form disjoint
    namespaces. After the first character (which must be a letter), a name can include any mix of
    letters and digits (and no other characters).

    Names are never removed from a set (although the current local set is regularly discarded and
    replaced by a new one as a whole). Names are inserted in each of these sets as the dataset gets
    processed according to the rules set forth by the SMILE specification. Boolean expressions and
    conditional value expressions can then be evaluated as they occur in type and property
    attributes, replacing names contained in one of the sets by true, and other names by false.

    To deal with the nested nature of a SMILE dataset, this class actually maintains a stack of
    local name sets. A fresh local name set can be be pushed onto the stack just before the engine
    starts handling a compound property, and popped from the stack when the engine has completed
    handling the property. */
