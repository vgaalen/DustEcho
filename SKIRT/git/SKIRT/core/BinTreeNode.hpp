/** BinTreeNode is a TreeNode subclass that represents nodes in a binary tree, where each
    subsequent level subdivides a node into two equal portions along one of the coordinate planes.
    The class implements an alternating subdivision scheme, i.e. the nodes are alternatively
    divided perpendicular to each of the three coordinate axes when descending the tree. */

        and spatial extent. The constructor sets the level of the new node to be one higher than
        the level of the parent. If the pointer to the parent is null, the level of the new node is
